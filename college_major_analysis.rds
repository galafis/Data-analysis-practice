RDS format simulation for college major analysis

This file represents the R data serialization (RDS) file that would be generated by the matahari package's dance_save() function.

In a real R environment, this file would contain:
1. The complete history of R commands executed during the analysis
2. The outputs and results of those commands
3. The state of relevant objects and variables

Since we cannot directly execute R code in this environment, this file serves as a placeholder for the actual RDS file that would be generated when running the college_major_analysis.R script in R/RStudio.

To use this in a real R environment:
1. Run the college_major_analysis.R script in R/RStudio
2. The script will generate a proper college_major_analysis.rds file
3. The generated RDS file can be loaded using readRDS("college_major_analysis.rds")
